# difflist

> [Difference lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_list) in Elixir

## Install

In your `mix.exs`:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:difflist, "~> 1.0.0"}
  ]
end
```

Then run `mix deps.get`.

## Background

Difference lists are a way of encoding a list as the action of preappending them. Instead of a list being `[1, 2, 3]`, it is the anonymous function `fn(ys) -> [1, 2, 3] ++ ys end`.

Difference lists are fast for left-associated appends (`list ++ [x]`) as they are represented as function composition.

Refer to [this](http://h2.jaguarpaw.co.uk/posts/demystifying-dlist/) excellent blog post for more information.

## Usage

The best place to read the documentation is in [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm/difflist/) or in `iex` (e.g. `h DiffList.from_list`).

This package exposes a `DiffList` module with the following functions:

### Creating difference lists

#### `DiffList.from_list/1`

Creates a difference list from a regular list.

#### `DiffList.empty/0`

Creates an empty difference list.

#### `DiffList.singleton/1`

Creates a difference list of one element.

### Using difference lists

#### `DiffList.append/2`

Appends a difference list to another difference list.

#### `DiffList.cons/2`

Prepends an item to a difference list.

#### `DiffList.snoc/2`

Appends an item to a difference list.

#### `DiffList.head/1`

Gets the first item of a difference list.

#### `DiffList.tail/1`

Gets the tail (a difference list of everything but the first item) of a difference list.

#### `DiffList.concat/1`

Concatenates a list of difference lists into one difference list.

## Benchmark

A simple left-associated append benchmark is included. Run `mix bench` to run it.
